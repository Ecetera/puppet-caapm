# How to install silently and use this file: 
#
# Introscope can be installed in silent mode (i.e. requiring no 
# interaction with a GUI or console). A silent install can use the 
# settings specified in a response file. 
#
# Silent installation can be performed as follows:
#
# Place this file in any directory. 
# Select the appropriate command format from the list below,
# and enter it at the command line to invoke the installer:
#
#   installer.exe -f <absolute path to response file>
#   installer.bin -f <absolute path to response file>
#   java -classpath installer.jar install -f <absolute path to response file>
